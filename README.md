# SquidOS

A x86-i686 operating system written in C++

## What is SquidOS?

SquidOS is a x86-i686 (32-bit) operating system written in C++, C and x86 assembler. Currently, SquidOS is nothing more than a very simplistic kernel. But with time and effort, it may become something more.

## Why does SquidOS exist?

SquidOS is a personal project, an adventure into the unknown. It has no specific uses and isn't really designed to do anything in particular (which is convenient, since it does next to nothing).

## Why. WHY?

*shrugs* I don't know. Curiosity I guess. Mixed with a hint of masochism. Ok, probably a lot of masochism.
